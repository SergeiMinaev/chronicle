Chronicle is an addon for World of Warcraft to collect and display some historical statistics of your character.

It collects such data (one entry per day):
* Level ups
* Time played
* Honorable kills
* Gold
* Achievements
* Completed quests
* Profession skills

Chronicle is still in development. At this moment implemented:
* Data collecting
* Very primitive data displaying

However, you can already install Chronicle and let it collect data. In the future, the display of statistics will be implemented and you will be able to analyze your existing data with it.

The data is stored in WTF\Account\<account_id>\SavedVariables\Chronicle.lua

Usage:
/chronicle - to show main frame
